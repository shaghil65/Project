**How you approach the task?**
We first go through the documentation of scikit-learn documentation. We first observe that what are multiclasses then we selected multiple classifiers according to our data set
requirement and used the best 4 classifiers for training our 8 models. We researched about the project to fulfil the requirements. We have made multiple submmissions on kaggle and
tried our best to acheieve highest accuracy and for achieving this accuracy we have tweak our classifiers by adjusting thier parameters.

**Which models you selected and why?**


**Problems you faced?**
One of the main problem was that our dataset had NAN values in 3 columns so we dropped them to make the accurracy higher then we had another major problem of normalizing our training data so we met our teacher Mr. Farooq who had guided us in how to normalize data. After this meeting our problem got solved.
